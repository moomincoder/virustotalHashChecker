# virustotalHashChecker
This script takes a SHA256 or MD5 hash value and a Virustotal API key and uploads it to Virustotal and returns the results, it also includes some input validation to make sure that the hash is valid
There is no help page for the script and there are not any arguments you can pass, just run the script and it will ask for additional input
The only dependency is https://pypi.org/project/virustotal-python/
